Thanks for your interest in contributing to pypco!

Contributions are always welcome. Here are a few things to keep in mind if you're contributing code:

1. Don't make major changes without creating an issue to talk about it first.
2. Don't break backwards compatibility for anyone who is currently using the library.
3. Provide unit tests with your code. Code won't be merged until it has test coverage; the quickest way to make that happen is for you to provide tests with your pull request. If you're fixing a bug, write a unit test that fails by triggering the bug. Then, make the change to fix the bug, proving that your code resolves the problem.
4. Update the documentation if your code makes a change (or update/improvement) to user-facing behavior. Code that makes user-facing changes will not be merged until those changes are documented. The quickest way to make that happen is for you to update the documenation appropriately as part of your pull request.
5. Provide helpful docstrings for any new functions you add, and update docstrings as needed if you make enhancements or add new parameters a user might want to know about.
